HOW TO COMPILE FOR A NEW TARGET

Adding a new target computer with no sound, no joystick/gamepad inpu 
and no user-defined graphics can be as simple as just recompiling 
with no modification if the compiler supports conio.h. 

In most cases this won't produce the best result. So some little tuning
is usually necessary.

If no conio is natively supported, some little conio wrapper and/or
re-implementation of the display APIs in display_macros.c is necessary.

Here we describe the simplest cases when conio is already available,
no sound and no user defined graphics is expected.

Usually you have to do the following steps:

1. SCREEN SIZE
By default screen size is 16x16 cells.
So, if you want your target (e.g., NEW_TARGET) to use a different cell count.
You need to compile with the -D__NEW_TARGET__ option to let the code know you
are compiling for NEW_TARGET
edit display_macros.h and add something like:
...
#elif defined(__NEW_TARGET__)
	#define XSize <desired X cell resolution>
...
#elif defined(__NEW_TARGET__)
	#define YSize <desired Y cell resolution>
...

2. SPEED
By default no slow down is inserted in the main loop but in some cases your game
may run too fast.
So you will need to edit settings.h to add some slow-down:
...
#elif defined(__NEW_TARGET__)
	#define SLOW_DOWN
	#define GAME_SLOW_DOWN <number of slow-down cycles>
...

3. SLEEP
If the compiler does not implement the sleep function, you need to either implement one
yourself or compile with -DNO_SLEEP if you want no sleep.

4. KEYBOARD INPUT
Some targets may detect key-presses as capital and others as small letters.
You can tune this in settings.h.

5. INPUT 
Some targets may no implement getk to read the keyboard input.
In this case you need to provide a substitute in input_macros.h and input_macros.c
