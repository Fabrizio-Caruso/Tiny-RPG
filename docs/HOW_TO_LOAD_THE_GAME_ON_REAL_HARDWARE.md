## Loading the game into a real vintage system
The loading procedure depends on the systems and the format used to store the game. 

- Most vintage systems used cassette players. For such systems the .wav or any other reproducible format (e.g., mp3) 
is the easiest solution because it can be played by a PC or smartphone connected to the audio in of the vintage system.
If a different format is produced, we suggest the use of a tool to convert into a playable.
If the emulator supports the creation of .wav files, one way to do this is to use the `save` or equivalent BASIC command.
- Several vintage systems use floppy disks. 
Some hardware solutions (e.g., XUM1541 cables for the Commodore 8-bit series) can be used to transfer disk images into real disks. 
Some other hardware solutions (SD2IEC for the Commodore 8-bit series, SI2SD for the Atari 8-bit series) allow the use disk images by a vintage system.
- Some other systems use cartridges. Cartridge images can be store into EPROMs or can be used directly by some special hardware (e.g., EasyFlash for the Commodore 64).
