Using the bbcim library
-----------------------

Put
	#include <bbcim.h>
in your C/C++ source, and link the objects with -lbbcim (and  possibly
-L<install location of libbbcim>)

All functions  return 0 if there  was no error,  otherwise, a negative
value is returned (docs on this will come later). Use verbose=1 to let
the library print out errors to stderr.

In both  cases 'bbcim_error' is  a pointer to  a string with  the last
error message, and 'bbcim_errno' the corresponding error number.

See lib/include/bbcim.h  for all structs  and error messages  (this is
not yet complete).
