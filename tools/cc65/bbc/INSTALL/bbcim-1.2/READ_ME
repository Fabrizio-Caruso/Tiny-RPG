bbcim (BBC computer file conversion utility) (C) 1995-2016 W.H.Scholten
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is version 1.2

       bbcim  is  a  file conversion utility to help in transferring files and
       for use with emulators, like creating disk images (Acorn DFS  and other
       formats),  adding  files  to them, extracting files from them, minimise
       the size of these images etc.

For more information, see the manual page: 'man bbcim'. The manual page is
also included in the help function. Start with 'bbcim -h' and then e.g.
'bbcim -help -c' will give more information on the catalogue option -c.


Compiling and installing bbcim:
-------------------------------
You need an ansi C-compiler. I used: pcc 1.1.0, clang 3.4.1 and gcc 4.8.5.
Set the environment variable CC to the compiler you want to use, e.g.

  export CC=pcc

Edit prog/_config.h and lib/_config.h before compiling, then:

'make'			compiles bbcim, linked against a static library.
'make clean'		removes objects, libraries and executables.
'make install'		installs bbcim in $(HOME)/bin/, and the manpage in
			$(HOME)/man/.
'make uninstall'	removes bbcim from $(HOME)/bin/, and the manpage from
			$(HOME)/man/.


If you want to make/install shared libraries, go to the directory lib:

'make shared'		compiles the shared library.
'make install.lib'	installs the shared library libbbcim.so.1.0 and the
			header file bbcim.h
'make uninstall.lib'	removes the library and header file.
